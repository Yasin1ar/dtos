# pystyler : Python Styler

## Converts the annoying dots (.) and underscores(_) in the movies name to spaces. 

### For renaming large amount of files according to our preference, in any filesystem (despite it's ancestor dtos) pystyler made, pure python.

**The reason that I wrote this code, was the failur that I got when I wanted to style my files on external hard drive which has NTFS filesystem, with dtos.**

### dtos is good, but only on linux filesystems, so I highly encourage you to use this instead, more simple, safer, and even faster, and requirement is python being installed on your system.

## *How to use? just put the script in the directory you want to restyle it's .mkv and .mp4 files, and execute it, that's it :)*
